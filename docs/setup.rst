Setup & Configuration
=====================

The main part of configuration regarding *rTorrent-PS* itself is already done,
if you followed  :ref:`DebianInstallFromSource` or used `pimp-my-box`_ for it.

This chapter provides some background on the standard configuration and how you can tweak it,
and contains hints on what you might need to do regarding
the runtime environment and your system setup.

You can skip to the :doc:`next chapter <manual>` to learn about
the special rTorrent-PS features and come back to this later,
provided everything looks ok to you when you first started *rTorrent-PS*
(especially if all special characters render correctly).
