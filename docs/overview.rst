The tested and supported platforms are Debian and any Debian-related Linux distro.
*Arch Linux* is supported via contributors,
and anything else will likely work too,
but in the end *you* have to fix any problems that might occur.
If you want better support for your platform, provide a *working* derivative of
``Dockerfile.Debian`` and necessary modifications to ``build.sh`` via a PR.
